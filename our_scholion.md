**The Scholion**

> ἀποκοπή ἐστι τοῦ <q>κέρατα</q>: ἢ συναλιφὴ τοῦ <q>κέραα</q>: πῶς δὲ δύναται κέρας εἶναι δύο καὶ ἥμισυ πήχεων: ἢ οὐκ ἐπὶ ἑκατέρου τοῦτο <choice><abbr>φὴ</abbr><expan>φησί</expan></choice> ἀλλ' ἁμφοτέρων⁑

> An *apocopē* ("a cutting off") of the word "κέρατα"; or, an avoidance of hiatus of the word "κέραα"; but how is it possible that the horn is two and a half cubits; [it is either impossible] or he says this not about each one, but about both ⁑
